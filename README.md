# Mastering-JS

Welcome to my journey through the landscape of JavaScript. Starting from an intermediate level, this repository is my digital chronicle where I am learning advanced JavaScript concepts and documenting each step of the way. My ultimate goal is to hone my problem-solving skills, developing a keen sense of logic that allows me to craft solutions independently.

## Resources

### Books:

The cornerstone of my study materials, here are some books that are guiding me through the JavaScript universe:

- [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net) - A modern introduction to programming with JavaScript, not just for the browser but as a language in its own right.

## How I'm Learning

- Reading books about javascript while coding along and making problems to solve with every chapter.
- Watching youtube videos to understand advanced concepts and applying them to personal projects amd work.
- Atending workshops and seminars to learn about new design patters.
